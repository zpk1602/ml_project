# What Happened to Great Games
A machine learning project exploring quality, trends, and success in the video game industry

This project was inspired by memories I have been thinking of lately from my childhood. When I was young, my friend and I used to spend a lot of time riding our bikes around the block, going for a swim in his backyard pool, role-playing in a zombie apocalypse at the park, and so much more. When our legs gave out and we needed some time to rest, we would go inside and play on the PlayStation or Xbox.

Back then, games felt different. They were about having fun with your friends, getting totally immersed in a world and figuring things out together. There was a kind of simplicity that made those games memorable.

As I've grown over the past 10+ years that I've been gaming, something about that feeling started to fade. I’m not sure if it was the games themselves, the way the industry evolved, or just the way we experience them now. I started to wonder if this was just nostalgia speaking, or if there was a way I could prove that others feel the same.

Now that I've graduated from UIUC and have studied computer science for years, I want to use what I've learned to explore that question. My goal with this project is to dig into real data and see if there's evidence that gaming has changed, not just in how they're made, but how they're received, how they succeed, and what makes them resonate with people today.

To do that, I’ll be combining data analysis with machine learning. Once I’ve explored the trends, I’ll use classification and regression models to predict things like sales performance, review scores, or popularity based on features like genre, platform, and release timing. The idea is to test whether success and reception can still be explained by the same factors over time, or if something has changed in what makes a game stand out.


## Gameplan
I want to figure out if games have actually changed in a meaningful way, or if it's just nostalgia talking. I'll be looking at three datasets that each give a different angle on the question.

### 1. Popular Video Games (1980-2023)
Focus on review scores first. Look at how they've changed over time and what affects them. Try to predict scores based on:
- Genre
- Release year
- Written reviews
- Publisher or Franchise

### 2. Video Game Sales
Check what kinds of games sold well. Build a model to predict high or low sales using features like platform, genre, and score.

### 3. Best-Selling Steam Games of All Time
Focus on modern PC games. Predict success (owners or reviews) using price, ratings, and genre tags.

## What Comes After
Once I've explored each dataset on its own, I'll use models to see if things like genre, platform, or release gear can actually predict success. If the patterns still hold today, that tells me something. If they don’t, that might point to how the industry has shifted.

The goal is to build models that are accurate and useful, not just to predict outcomes. I want to help explain which factors really matter in a game's reception and performance.

## Reach Goal
Ideally, I'd like to display these findings in a simple interactive dashboard or webpage. Something that lets people explore the trends, compare games by score or genre, and see for themselves how things have changed over time.
